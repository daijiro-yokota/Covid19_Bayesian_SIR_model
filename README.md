# Covid19_Bayesian_SIR_model

This is my capstone project for STAT 451: Bayesian Statistics with Professor A. Johnson in 2020 Spring. 
This was my second capstone class in Statistics at Macalester College. 
I worked with two other students, Christina Kai '20 and Ciara Moore '21.

We built a Shiny application that fits time-series SIR model on the COVID-19 data updated everyday publically.
The data is gathered from Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center and other public data sources.
